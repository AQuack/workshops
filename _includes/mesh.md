As part of the Ansible Automation Platform 2.1 release, we introduced one of the most long-awaited features: automation mesh.  Automation mesh is an overlay network intended to ease the distribution of work across a large and dispersed collection of workers. Mesh nodes establish peer-to-peer connections with each other across your existing networks bringing automation closer to the endpoints that need it. 

This distributed design enables you to reliably and consistently automate at scale, across on-premises environments, the hybrid cloud, and to the edge. It delivers flexible design options, from single-site deployments to fault-tolerant platform installations spanning the globe, with a security-first approach.

Automation mesh is already configured and ready to use in your workshop environment. Please try our hands-on, interactive labs to learn more about automation mesh and other Ansible Automation Platform features.
